The idea of the app is to give a group of users the same amount of digital ”cash” and randomly select a few of them to create ”art” which will really be a simple digital drawing or original sound recording but no photographs or videos (assuming this was a live application it would reset every few months).
They can then start an auction for that ”art” with either a select group of individuals to serve as the bidders or just a random assortment of bidders. The artists can see the bidding history of bidders who they have chosen. Bidders who have made a bid equal to a certain percentage of their worth but did not win can choose from a group of unsold ”art” pieces. Auctions can last 5 minutes. Those who own art can take AR photos of the art and put them on their profile, something like a virtual gallery.
